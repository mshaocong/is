This is an extension of a simulation course project. A general frame for importance sampling is implemented here. It will contains the following part: 

1. Sampling a stochastic process (under the realistic measure). 

2. Change of measure - usually we want to sample the stochastic process from a different measure (given the Radon-Nikodym density)

3. Siegmund algorithm

4. I will write a note about its application

# A brief introduction to importance sampling

# Sampling
Generate Markov processes given transition density. 

# Importance Sampling
Consider several cases of rare event. Use IS to estimate the probability.
